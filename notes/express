There is a helpful partial specification of methods available on the 
express application, request, and respones objects in the book in the section "The application,
requests, and response objects".

Configuration:
Set the NODE_ENV variable in the shell. It will then be available in js files as 
process.env.NODE_ENV. Confirm that it is properly set in the main file (server.js).

config/config.js loads a confiuration file from the env directory, depending 
on the process.env.NODE_ENV variable.
Use a `const config = require('..../config');` where you need access to the 
variables defined in it.
