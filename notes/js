Import: works kinda like in python.
Export
Export says what can be imported. It prevents namespace pollution. Not every variable
in a file gets imported when you import the file. Only the exported ones. 

CommonJS Modules
As best I can tell, a module is like a singleton. You can require it in one place, 
do something to it, require it in a different place and it retains the state 
you gave it in the first place.
